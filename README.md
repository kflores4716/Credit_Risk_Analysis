# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

In this analysis, we created 6 machine learning models, each with a goal of predicting credit risk. We built our models using the `imbalanced-learn` and `scikit-learn` libraries in `Jupyter notebook`. Once our models were built, trained, and tested, we evaluated their performances to determine whether we should or should not recommend using them to predict credit risk.

## Results

Here are the results from all 6 of our machine learning models. The results will include each model's balanced accuracy score, a confusion matrix, and a classification report that will display their precision and recall scores.

#### Random Over Sampling



#### SMOTE



#### Cluster Centroids



#### SMOTEENN



#### Balanced Random Forest Classifier



#### Easy Ensemble Classifier
